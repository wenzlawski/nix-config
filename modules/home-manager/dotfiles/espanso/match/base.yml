# espanso match file

# For a complete introduction, visit the official docs at: https://espanso.org/docs/

# You can use this file to define the base matches (aka snippets)
# that will be available in every application when using espanso.

# Matches are substitution rules: when you type the "trigger" string
# it gets replaced by the "replace" string.
matches:
  - trigger: ";br"
    replace: "Best regards,\nMarc Wenzlawski"
  - trigger: ";today"
    replace: "{{date}}"
    vars:
